# WeatherApp

## About the app
This app uses the [Open Weather Map API](http://www.openweathermap.org/API#weather)
to get the weather in different cities. 

The application is written with JS and jQuery. 

## Check production build
Open the index.html file located in the 'dist' directory. 

## Development
I used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for this project for having a webserver locally to 
check for changes in the javascript or the scss files. 

For compiling sass to css you need the [Ruby sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) gem. 

## Start locally
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/majkoll/weatherApp
$ cd weatherApp
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
